# Welcome to Chanwoo's Pages

I am a new Joint Doctoral Program student in department of Geography at San Diego State University and UC Santa Barbara.<br/>

My research interestes are Big Data (Social media data), Geocomputation, Spatio-temporal Statistical Modeling, and Human dynamics.<br/>
I am going to upload some codes of R, python, and Javascript on this pages.

Any kinds of questions and recommendations are welcome!

## Previous Researches

I have published M.A. thesis and 5 papers (3 papers with first author) in Korean peer-review Journals, and most of them are related to analysis of real estate market in Seoul using (usually) R.

Here is a list:
* M.A. Thesis: Analysis of the Spatio-temporal Interaction Patterns of the Housing Sales and Rent Price Using SpVAR-Lasso

* Lee, G., **Jin, C.**, Kim, J., and Kim, W. (2016). A Study on the Characteristics of the Spatial Distribution of Sex Crimes. *Journal of the Korean Geographical Society, 51(6)*, 853-871.
* **Jin, C.**, and Lee, G. (2016). Analysis of the Spatio-temporal Interaction Patterns of the Housing Sales and Rent Price Using SpVAR. *Journal of Real Estate Analysis, 2(2)*, 25-44.
* Choi, S., Lee, S., **Jin, C.**, and Lee, C. (2016). Exploring Availability of Real-estate Market Consumer Sentiment Index to Estimate Real-estate Overheating Regions. *The Korea Spatial Planning Review, 88*, 25-41.
* **Jin, C.**, and Lee, G. (2015). Optimal Location Modeling for Happy Houses. *Journal of the Korean Urban Geographical Society, 18(2)*, 81-95.
* **Jin, C.**, and Lee, G. (2014). Spatial Hedonic Modeling Using Geographically Weighted LASSO Model, *Journal of the Korean Geographical Society, 49(6)*, 917-934.
